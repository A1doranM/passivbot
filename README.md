v7.0.2


## Overview

Passivbot is a cryptocurrency trading bot written in Python and Rust, intended to require minimal user intervention.  

It operates on perpetual futures derivatives markets, automatically creating and cancelling limit buy and sell orders on behalf of the user. It does not try to predict future price movements, it does not use technical indicators, nor does it follow trends. Rather, it is a contrarian market maker, providing resistance to price changes in both directions, thereby "serving the market" as a price stabilizer.  

Passivbot's behavior may be backtested on historical price data, using the included backtester whose CPU heavy functions are written in Rust for speed. Also included is an optimizer, which finds better configurations by iterating thousands of backtests with different candidates, converging on the optimal ones with an evolutionary algorithm.  

## Strategy

Inspired by the Martingale betting strategy, the robot will make a small initial entry and double down on its losing positions multiple times to bring the average entry price closer to current price action. The orders are placed in a grid, ready to absorb sudden price movements. After each re-entry, the robot quickly updates its closing orders at a set take-profit markup. This way, if there is even a minor market reversal, or "bounce", the position can be closed in profit, and it starts over.  

### Forager
The Forager feature dynamically chooses the most volatile markets on which to open positions. Volatility is defined as the mean of the normalized relative range for the most recent 1m candles, i.e. `mean((ohlcv.high - ohlcv.low) / ohlcv.close)`.

### Unstucking Mechanism
Passivbot manages underperforming, or "stuck", positions by realizing small losses over time. If multiple positions are stuck, the bot prioritizes positions with the smallest gap between the entry price and current market price for "unstucking". Losses are limited by ensuring that the account balance does not fall under a set percentage below the past peak balance.  


## Installation

To install Passivbot and its dependencies, follow the steps below.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone the Passivbot repository to the local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/enarjord/passivbot.git
cd passivbot
```


### Step 2: Install Rust
Passivbot uses Rust for some of its components. Install Rust by following these steps:

Visit https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
Follow the instructions for your operating system to install Rustup, the Rust installer and version management tool.
After installation, restart your terminal or command prompt.

### Step 3: Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```sh
python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows:
  ```sh
  .\venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- On macOS and Linux:
  ```sh
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### Step 4: Install Python Dependencies

Install all the required Python dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 5: Build Rust Extensions

Navigate to the `passivbot-rust` directory and build the Rust extensions using `maturin`:

```sh
cd passivbot-rust
maturin develop --release
cd ..
```

Note that the Rust bindings must be recompiled for changes in the Rust source to take effect.

### Step 6: Add API keys

Make a copy of the api-keys template file:

```sh
cp api-keys.json.example api-keys.json
```

Add your keys to api-keys.json.

### Step 6: Run Passivbot

Make a live configuration file, using `configs/live/example_config.hjson` as a template.

To start the bot, run:

```sh
python src/main.py configs/live/example_config.hjson
```

## Jupyter Lab

Jupyter lab needs to be run in the same virtual environment as the bot. Activate venv (see installation instructions above, step 3), and launch Jupyter lab from the Passivbot root dir with:
```shell
python3 -m jupyter lab
```

## Requirements

- Python >= 3.8
- [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) dependencies

## Pre-optimized configurations
