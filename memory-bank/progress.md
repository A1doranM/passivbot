   - Enhanced error messaging and diagnostics

3. **Technical Enhancements**
   - Additional performance optimizations
   - Further Rust migration for performance-critical components
   - Expanded test coverage
   - Enhanced logging and monitoring capabilities

4. **Feature Extensions**
   - Additional risk management features
   - More sophisticated market selection algorithms
   - Enhanced position sizing strategies
   - Integration with additional data sources

5. **Integration Expansion**
   - Support for additional exchanges
   - Integration with external analytics platforms
   - Portfolio management capabilities across multiple trading pairs

## Current Status

Passivbot is a mature project at version 7.3.11, with a stable codebase and established functionality. The core trading strategy, exchange integrations, and operational tools are fully implemented and operational.

### Recent Developments

## Known Issues

Since this is the initial memory bank setup without deep code analysis, specific issues cannot yet be enumerated in detail. However, general areas of consideration include:

1. **Performance Considerations**
   - Optimization process is computationally intensive
   - Large backtests can consume significant memory
   - Some operations may benefit from further optimization

2. **Exchange Limitations**
   - API rate limits can affect operation during high volatility
   - Exchange-specific quirks may affect order execution
   - Market precision requirements differ between exchanges

3. **Strategy Limitations**
   - Grid strategy may underperform in strong trend markets
   - Parameter optimization is specific to backtest conditions
   - Unstucking mechanism realization of losses may impact overall performance

4. **Operational Considerations**
   - Requires stable internet connection
   - Depends on exchange API reliability
   - Long-running processes need monitoring

As the project is explored in more depth, specific issues will be documented here with greater detail, including status, severity, and potential workarounds or solutions.
