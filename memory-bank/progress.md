## Known Issues

Since this is the initial comprehensive memory bank documentation, specific issues are now being cataloged with more detail:

1. **Performance Considerations**
   - Optimization process is computationally intensive, requiring significant CPU resources for large parameter spaces
   - Large backtests can consume significant memory, particularly when optimizing across multiple symbols simultaneously
   - OHLCV data caching can consume significant disk space for long-term backtesting
   - Some operations may benefit from further optimization, particularly in hot paths like order calculation

2. **Exchange Limitations**
   - API rate limits can affect operation during high volatility, potentially causing delayed order execution
   - Exchange-specific quirks may affect order execution, with different latency characteristics per platform
   - Market precision requirements differ between exchanges, requiring careful rounding of prices and quantities
   - Websocket connection stability varies between exchanges, affecting real-time data reliability

3. **Strategy Limitations**
   - Grid strategy may underperform in strong trend markets, as positions can become stuck when price moves significantly in one direction
   - Parameter optimization is specific to backtest conditions, with performance potentially varying in different market regimes
   - Unstucking mechanism realization of losses may impact overall performance during extended adverse market conditions
   - Forager mode may select coins that have short-term volatility but poor long-term characteristics

4. **Operational Considerations**
   - Requires stable internet connection for reliable exchange communication
   - Depends on exchange API reliability and consistency
   - Long-running processes need monitoring and potential restart capabilities
   - Balance withdrawals require reconfiguration of wallet exposure parameters
   - Exchange maintenance periods may disrupt trading operations
