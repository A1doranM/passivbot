# Active Context for Passivbot

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on understanding and documenting the Passivbot project structure, architecture, and functionality through the creation of a comprehensive memory bank. This serves as a foundation for future development, maintenance, and enhancement work.

### Primary Areas of Focus

1. **Project Documentation**
   - Creating the memory bank structure
   - Documenting core components, architecture, and design patterns
   - Establishing a baseline understanding of the system

2. **System Architecture Understanding**
   - Analyzing the relationship between Python and Rust components
   - Understanding the exchange adapter system
   - Mapping the optimization and backtesting architecture

3. **Configuration System**
   - Understanding how different parameters affect the trading strategy
   - Documenting configuration options and their effects
   - Analyzing the relationship between configuration and performance

## Recent Changes

As this is the initial documentation effort, there are no recent code changes to document. However, the following documentation has been established:

1. **Memory Bank Creation**
   - Project brief has been preserved from existing documentation
   - Product context has been created based on project understanding
   - System patterns have been documented to capture architecture
   - Technical context has been established to document technology stack
   - Active context (this document) has been created
   - Progress tracking will be established

2. **Knowledge Organization**
   - Core trading strategies have been identified and documented
   - Key components have been mapped in system architecture diagrams
   - Technical stack and dependencies have been cataloged

## Next Steps

The following immediate next steps are planned:

1. **Complete Memory Bank Setup**
   - Finalize remaining memory bank documents
   - Create .clinerules file for project-specific patterns
   - Establish progress tracking baseline

2. **Deep Dive into Core Components**
   - Analyze the main trading algorithm implementation
   - Examine the optimization system in detail
   - Understand the exchange integration mechanisms
   - Document the backtesting and simulation system

3. **Configuration Analysis**
   - Examine example configurations to understand parameter ranges
   - Document the effect of different parameters on strategy behavior
   - Create reference documentation for configuration options

4. **Potential Enhancement Areas**
   - Identify opportunities for improved documentation
   - Note potential areas for performance optimization
   - Consider additions to visualization and analysis tools

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architectural Decisions

1. **Python/Rust Division of Responsibility**
   - Python handles coordination, user interface, and exchange communication
   - Rust handles performance-critical calculations and backtesting
   - This hybrid approach balances flexibility with performance
   - Future work should maintain this separation of concerns

2. **Exchange Adapter Design**
   - Exchange-specific code is isolated in adapter modules
   - Core logic remains exchange-agnostic
   - New exchange integrations should follow existing adapter pattern
   - Consider refactoring common adapter functionality if adding new exchanges

3. **Configuration System**
   - JSON-based configuration provides flexibility
   - Parameters are validated and normalized at runtime
   - Future enhancements should maintain backward compatibility
   - Consider adding schema validation for configuration files

### Strategic Considerations

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Backtesting speed is critical for optimization effectiveness
   - Continue to move performance-critical code to Rust where appropriate
   - Consider parallel processing for optimization workloads
   - Profile and optimize hot paths in both Python and Rust code

2. **Risk Management**
   - The unstucking mechanism is a key risk management feature
   - Balance between aggressive trading and capital preservation
   - Consider additional risk controls for extreme market conditions
   - Evaluate position sizing algorithms for effectiveness

3. **User Experience**
   - Balance between flexibility and ease of use
   - Focus on clear documentation and examples
   - Consider visualization improvements for strategy understanding
   - Evaluate logging and monitoring capabilities for live trading

### Current Questions and Unknowns

1. **Exchange-Specific Behavior**
   - How do different exchanges behave during extreme market conditions?
   - Are there significant latency differences between exchanges?
   - How do exchange fees affect strategy profitability?

2. **Strategy Parameter Sensitivity**
   - Which parameters have the largest impact on performance?
   - Are there parameter combinations that should be avoided?
   - How does parameter optimization transfer between market conditions?

3. **Long-Term Performance**
   - How does the strategy perform across different market regimes?
   - What is the expected drawdown during adverse conditions?
   - How frequently should parameters be re-optimized?

These active considerations will guide future exploration and development efforts as we work with the Passivbot system.
